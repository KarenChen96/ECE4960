Programming Assignment 4: Compact SPICE for ODE Solution

Code components:

1. mainP4.java are the implementations with respect to two circuits in Assignment 4 using given parameter.

2. ODEModel.java contains all steps we implement to construct ODE solver, inlcuding three different methods: 
Forward Euler method, RK4 method and RK34 method.

3. rowFunction.java contains vectors-related methods/fucntions that may be used during we build up the solver in ODEModel.java.

4. testClass.java is the class for testing of ODE solvers and helper functions.

5. test.java is the file containing various type of norm calculations (of vectors) that we will use in ODEModel.java.

5. PlotingCode.ipynb is the code for all ploting works in this assignment.

Other folders:
1. ValidationForODESolver contains the output (the plot normalized error vs time for different solvers) of the 
validation of ODE solver(task3)

2. SimulationPlot&Output contains the plot for v1(t) and v2(t) in RC circuit(task4)

3. Amplifier contains the output of CS amplifier circuit (task5)
