Programming Assignment 4: Compact SPICE for ODE Solution

Code components:

1. mainP4.java contains implementation with respect to two circuits in Assignment 4 using given parameter.

2. ODEModel.java contains all steps we implement to construct ODE solver, inlcuding three different methods: 
Forward Euler method, RK4 method and RK34 method.

3. rowFunction.java contains all vectors-related methods/fucntions that we may use during build up the solver in ODEModel.java.

4. test.java is the class for testing of ODE solvers and helper functions.
