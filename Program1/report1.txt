*****Observe Integer overflow*****
pow(10, 10) is overflow
pow(2, 31) is overflow 
13! is overflow
 
*****Observe Integer divided by 0*****
Integer/0 is an Arithmetic Exception. 

*****Observe Floating-point overflows: *****
pow(10, 39.0) is overflow 
pow(2, 128.0) is overflow

*****Observe floating point gradual underflow with different methods*****
When a1 and b1 are less than the float normal minimum value, we can still obtain a1-b1 != 0 
or a1/b1 != 1 (2a = b), which means that a1 != b1, showing that gradual underflow exists.
