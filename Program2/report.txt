-----The main test for calculating the solution for an equation using iterative solver(Jacobi Solver)----- 
*****Calculate the resolution using Jacobi Iterative solver*****
When b = b1, Iteration that are needed for convergence is: 4
The normalized residual norm of iterative solver to b1 is: 1.458435828213199E-9
 
When b = b2, Iteration that are needed for convergence is: 4
The normalized residual norm of iterative solver to b2 is: 1.6660286669987395E-9
 
When b = b3, Iteration that are needed for convergence is: 6
The normalized residual norm of iterative solver to b3 is: 1.793087235983254E-9
 
 
*****Comments on the results*****
1. Observation:(1) Under the three cases, the normalized residual norm in the solution decrease with the number of iterations, which means the convergence of the solver is achieved.
(2) The monotonic convergence and relatively small normalized residual norm reflects that this problem is a well-conditioned one.
(3) Iterative solver's edge is that it can change the convergence condition
