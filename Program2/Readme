In this program, we try to use an iterative solver to solve Linear Systems of Equations: Ax = b. I implement Jacobi solver in my code.

To express the iterative expression of the solution xk, some martix that are derived from A are needed. 

So I created a class named "sparse_op" which contains operations to a sparse matrix, including 
obtaining upper matrix, lower matrix, etc. 

I also called function "Row_productAx" which was written before to do some necessary calculations.

Besides, I have a class named "formula" which contains some basic operations to a vector, such like obtaining 
first norm and second norm.

File "TestForFunctions" has tested all helper functions that have been called in the Jacobi solution, 
and file "mainTest" is the test for Jacobi method. File reading is also eralized in file "mainTest". 

Other files are the implementations for every method. "jacobi" is the implementaion for Jacobi solver.
