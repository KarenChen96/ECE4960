Lecture3_practice4: Calculate numerical approximations and errors for the function by using different methods.

Lecture4_practice1: Create the sparse matrix A in the row compressed format; 
                    Implement the function retrieveElement( ).  
                    
Lecture4_practice2: Use the row-compressed storage and the full-matrix representations to implement the vector product.
